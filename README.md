# Artificial Neural Network (ANN) Deep Learning Model

## This repository contains a Google Colab notebook that demonstrates how to build an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) deep learning model from scratch, along with an overview file designed for beginners to understand how models are built in deep learning.

# Overview

## In this repository, you'll find:

1. ANN Deep Learning Model Colab Notebook: This notebook walks through the process of building, training, and evaluating a simple Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model. The model is implemented using Python and popular deep learning libraries like TensorFlow/Keras.

2. Beginner's Guide to Deep Learning Models: This file provides an introductory overview for beginners who want to understand the basic concepts and components involved in building deep learning models. It includes explanations of the fundamental concepts like neural networks, activation functions, loss functions, and training processes.

# Files

- `Churn_Rate_Predection.ipynb`: A Google Colab notebook that demonstrates how to build and evaluate a model to predict customer churn rates.
- `MNIST_dataset_Deep_Learning_model.ipynb`: A Google Colab notebook that demonstrates how to build and evaluate a deep learning model using the MNIST dataset.

# Getting Started

To get started with the notebooks, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/amarjit03/ANN-model-building-for-beginner.git
    ```
2. Open the desired notebook in Google Colab:
    - For `Churn_Rate_Predection.ipynb`, open [this link](https://colab.research.google.com/github/amarjit03/ANN-model-building-for-beginner/blob/main/Churn_Rate_Predection.ipynb).
    - For `MNIST_dataset_Deep_Learning_model.ipynb`, open [this link](https://colab.research.google.com/github/amarjit03/ANN-model-building-for-beginner/blob/main/MNIST_dataset_Deep_Learning_model.ipynb).

3. Follow the instructions in the notebook to run the code and experiment with the models.

# Requirements

The notebooks are designed to run in Google Colab, which provides all the necessary dependencies. However, if you want to run them locally, you will need the following Python libraries:

- TensorFlow
- Keras
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib

You can install these dependencies using pip:
```sh
pip install tensorflow keras numpy pandas matplotlib
